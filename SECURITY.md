## Supported Versions

Currently, there is **no released and supported IDE version**. The alpha is under way which will be 3.0.0-ALPHA, but it has been under heavy development for over a year and will take a few more months to be released as alpha. This being said, any

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you may email us at security@ms-paint-i.de or contact the developer on Discord at `RubbaBoy#2832`, though the former being preferred. Security updates will be posted on [the GitHub security alerts tab](https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/MSPaintIDE/security/advisories) of the repository. Updates should be expected very soon depending on how complex the vulnerability is, as they take priority over any other features of bug fixes.

More information will be available both here and elsewhere in the repository about security vulnerability reporting/other information as the project progresses and I gain a better understanding of the GitHub Security feature.
